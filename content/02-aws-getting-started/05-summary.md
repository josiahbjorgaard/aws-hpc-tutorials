In this part of the workshop you accessed your account. If attending an AWS hosted event, then AWS ParallelCluster API and Pcluster Manager are already deployed and you start experimenting with these in the next parts. If you are running this HPC workshop outside of an AWS hosted event, please wait until the stacks are fully deployed.
