This workshop walks you through setting up your own HPC workloads. You learn how to navigate the AWS Management Console, access relevant services, and how to deploy a basic infrastructure.
Specifically, you learn how to:

- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and explore it.
- Deploy the AWS ParallelCluster API and Pcluster Manager stacks if not attending an AWS hosted even.

You can proceed to the next stage of the workshop once the preparation completed.

<!-- Total cost to run this lab is expected to be less than **two dollars should you run it on your own or company account** if the guide is followed as discussed, in one sitting, and including the deletion of all resources outlined through the guide. -->
