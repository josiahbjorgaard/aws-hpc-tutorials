[**PCluster Manager**](https://github.com/aws-samples/pcluster-manager) is an open source project that leverages the [AWS ParallelCluster API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/api-reference-v3.html) to create a web-based user interface for performing cluster management actions on your HPC clusters. This way you can create and manage your clusters through a web browser with point-and-click actions rather than through your terminal.

PCluster Manager is entirely serverless. Authentication is provided through Amazon Cognito, which is why we asked you to use a valid email as part of deploying PCluster Manager earlier in this workshop.
