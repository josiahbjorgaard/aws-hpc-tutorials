[**AWS ParallelCluster Manager**](https://github.com/aws-samples/pcluster-manager) is an opensource project providing a Web User Interface for AWS ParallelCluster using the [AWS ParallelCluster API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/api-reference-v3.html). It enables you to create and manage your clusters through your web browser instead of your terminal and is entirely serverless. Authentication capabilities are provided via Amazon Cognito (which is why a valid email was needed to deploy the stacks).
